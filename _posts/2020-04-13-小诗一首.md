title:  "小诗一首"
---

今天小朋友上网课，老师教了一首小诗，很好玩。网上搜了一下好像只有一个网友的[翻译](http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_4c9e1f6f0102e9sl.html)，我也来试一下：

聪明
Shel Silverstein

爸爸夸我聪明娃，奖我一张一块钱。
我换一对两毛五，两个比一多一点。
遇见邻居王小毛，换成三个一毛钱。
王小毛他数学差，三要比二多一点。
来了好友莫小贝，换成四个五分钱。
小贝小贝不识数，三个要比四个贱。
出门见到张老板，正在他的杂货店。
居然不知四更少，换我五个一分钱。
回家告诉我老爸，爸爸脸红鼻冒烟。
一定是我太聪明，老爸自豪不能言。

Smart

My dad gave me one dollar bill
'Cause I'm his smartest son,
And I swapped it for two shiny quarters
'Cause two is more than one!

And then I took the quarters
And traded them to Lou
For three dimes -- I guess he don't know
That three is more than two!

Just then, along came old blind Bates
And just 'cause he can't see
He gave me four nickles for my three dimes,
And four is more than three!

And I took the nickels to Hiram Coombs
Down at the seed-feed store,
And the fool gave me five pennies for them,
And five is more than four!

And then I went and showed my dad,
And he got red in the cheeks
And closed his eyes and shook his head--
Too proud of me to speak!

- Shel Silverstein
